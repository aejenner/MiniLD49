  <h1>MiniLD49 - Alien Planetary Expedition</h1>
  <p>Those pesky humans have been taking shots are your superior Yoloid space
  vessel again. The Yoloid hive mind instructs you and your crew to land at a
  nearby planet and pillage it for materials and resources and then return to
  Yolos. It is very unlikely you will encounter any filthy humans while on this 
  planet. For the eternal glory of Yolos!</p>
  <p>As an experienced Yoloid space commander, you already know that you will
  need to ensure that each of your crew has at least one unit of food every day,
  and that your ship must be repaired and fueled to take off again. You also
  know that if a region is hazardous, consider sending multiple crew members
  and possible arming them to reduce the risk of losing crew, or perhaps
  engage in a hunting mission to reduce the danger. Filthy humans have been
  known to sacrifice their crew on planetary expeditions (often marking them
  with red colored clothing), but not the superior Yoloeans! (No promises about
  the Yoloid from the Swaghus system; those clowns make poor decisions all the
  time.)</p>
